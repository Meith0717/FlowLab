# 2D Fluid Simulator for Bachelor Project in Computer Science Studies

Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor Project in Computer Science Studies, where I'll be developing a simple 2D fluid simulator. Inspired by the principles taught in the [Computer Graphics](https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de) offered by the University of Freiburg, this project aims to explore the fundamentals of fluid dynamics simulation within a computational environment.

This repository will serve as a hub for the development of the fluid simulator, providing an open and collaborative platform for tracking progress, sharing ideas, and contributing to the advancement of the project. Utilizing the knowledge and techniques gleaned from the course curriculum, I will implement algorithms and methods to simulate fluid behavior, including advection, diffusion, and pressure projection.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of computational fluid dynamics, sharpen my programming skills, and produce a functional tool for visualizing and analyzing fluid motion in a 2D space. The repository will contain code, documentation, and resources necessary for both development and understanding of the simulator, fostering transparency and accessibility for fellow enthusiasts and researchers.
