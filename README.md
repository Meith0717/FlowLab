# 2D Fluid Simulator for Bachelor in Computer Science Studies

Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor in Computer Science Studies, where I'll be developing a simple 2D fluid simulator. Inspired by the principles taught in the [Computer Graphics](https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de) offered by the University of Freiburg, this project aims to explore the fundamentals of fluid dynamics simulation within a computational environment.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of computational fluid dynamics, sharpen my programming skills, and produce a functional tool for visualizing and analyzing fluid motion in a 2D space. The repository will contain code, documentation, and resources necessary for both development and understanding of the simulator, fostering transparency and accessibility for fellow enthusiasts and researchers.
