# FlowLab — 2D Fluid Simulator  
*A Bachelor's Thesis Project in Computer Science*

![](./docs/teaser.png)

## 🎯 Overview  
**FlowLab** is a 2D fluid dynamics simulator developed as part of my [Bachelor’s thesis](./docs/thesis.pdf) at the **University of Freiburg**.  
It allows users to visualize and experiment with fluid behavior in a 2D environment using **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)** techniques.

This repository contains:
- The complete source code  
- The executable (available in the [latest release](https://github.com/Meith0717/FlowLab/releases/latest))  
- The full [thesis](./docs/thesis.pdf) document  
- Example media and a demonstration video

## 🚀 Demo & Media  
**Video demo:**  
[![FlowLab Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qm8a-ChkG9o/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm8a-ChkG9o)

## 🧱 Features  
- Implementation of both **Standard SPH (SESPH)** and **Implicit Incompressible SPH (IISPH)**  
- Real-time 2D particle-based fluid simulation  
- Interactive visualization and parameter tuning  
- Adjustable parameters: viscosity, time step, boundary conditions  
- Basic support for saving and reloading simulation states  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation  
The simulator is structured into modular components:

- **Simulation Core** — Implements both SESPH and IISPH formulations  
  - SESPH for direct density and pressure computation  
  - IISPH for solving incompressibility via a linear system (pressure Poisson equation)  
- **Neighbor Search** — Spatial hashing-based system for efficient particle neighborhood queries  
- **Rendering** — OpenGL-based real-time visualization of particles and fields  
- **I/O & Persistence** — Loading/saving of scenes and exporting simulation frames  

For detailed mathematical derivations and algorithmic explanations, refer to the [thesis](./docs/thesis.pdf).

## 📁 Getting Started  

### 🧩 Requirements  
- Windows (tested)  
- .NET 8.0 or newer  
- OpenGL-compatible GPU  

### ⚙️ Running the Executable  
You can download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Meith0717/FlowLab/releases/latest).  
Simply extract and run `FlowLab.exe`.

---

## 📄 Thesis & Documentation  
The thesis includes:
- A detailed introduction to SPH and IISPH  
- Algorithm derivations and solver design  
- Comparison between SESPH and IISPH in terms of performance and stability  
- Discussion of implementation challenges and results  

---

## 🧪 Results  
FlowLab demonstrates that the **IISPH** approach achieves improved stability and volume preservation compared to the **standard SPH** implementation, at the cost of additional computational complexity due to solving the pressure system iteratively.
